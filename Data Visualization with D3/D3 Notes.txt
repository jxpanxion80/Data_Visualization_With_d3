d3 is used to target the D3 object
select('body') targets the ‘body’ element of the HTML document
selectAll('h2') targets the existing ‘h2’ nodes that are children to the ‘body’ element
data(dataset) tells D3 that the data to be used is held within the variable dataset
enter() returns placeholder nodes for each datum that has no corresponding DOM element in the selection
append('h2') turns these placesholders in to ‘h2’ elements
text((d) => d + ' USD') uses JavaScripts callback functionality to insert each datum, d, as the text for each ‘h2’ node created previously and concatenates the required ’ USD’
